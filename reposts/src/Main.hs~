-- 2. Calculate probability of winning using simulation {reposts}

-- There's a contest going on in a Russian social network: seven prizes will be given to seven randomly chosen people among
-- those who have reposted a certain post. (There are actually 100 prizes, but the other 93 suck, so we'll ignore them.)
-- There are already ~1000000 reposts. My sister wonders: what's the probability of her winning at least one prize
-- (out of those seve) if she reposts the post 10 times (from different accounts)? What about 100 times? 1000 times?

-- Calculate the answer by running a simulation some number of times (for instance, 10000 times).
-- You can use System.Random or some other random library (e.g. Data.Random).

-- If you're not good at probabilistic simulations, here's a hint.
